# White-Hat
White Hat submission Task: 

I am juhi seshadri iyer from cyber security branch. 
I'm Very interested in joining the white hat club because for a long time, since 5th grade, my only goal was to become a white hat hacker and I have been working on that goal ever since. I started off with basic linux administration in ubuntu and python. I created many python projects (as you can see in my github) and other projects including bash programming. 
Then I moved onto Kali linux. Started creating my own attacks by programming in python and I have also done several Udemy courses and other courses on these topics. 
I am a rookie but also very eager to know and learn more about cyber security and ethical hacking :D.

I read about the Wanna cry ransomeware attack which was one of the worlds largest global cyberattacks
